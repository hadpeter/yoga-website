Yoga curious? Enjoy some fresh air while exploring yoga. No previous yoga experience or knowledge necessary.

Whether it is your first or your thousandth time stepping onto a yoga mat, this foundational class will meet you where you are by offering variations of postures so that you can choose what works best for you.

Class will be a vinyasa yoga style accessible to all levels. This means we will be connecting asanas, creating one cohesive flow of movement.

Suggested donation is $10 but know that if you are not in a financial place to donate your energy is more than enough. Please bring a mat and water bottle as these will not be provided.
