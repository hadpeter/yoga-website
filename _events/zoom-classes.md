Drop into yourself and your practice. Held every Wednesday, this class offers an opportunity to take a break mid week to bring your energy inward. What has supported you in the week thus far? How can you take what you cultivate on the mat to guide you through the rest of your week?

Class will be a vinyasa yoga style accessible to all levels. This means we will be connecting asanas, creating one cohesive flow of movement. Variations of poses will be offered so that regardless of where you are in your yoga journey, you can find an expression of the pose that suits you.

Suggested donation is $10 but know that if you are not in a financial place to donate your energy is more than enough.
